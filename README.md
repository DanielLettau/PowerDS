# PowerDS
A Powershell module for Digitalstrom.

For now this module only consists of a few commands I use to connect different devices to Digitalstrom. All the commands were tested on a dSS11-1GB with software version 1.54.0 / distro version 1.16.7

Please understand that this Module is in a very early stage. I cannot tell now how it will go on.
